## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get the application up and running:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd ecommerce-mern-stack-app
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install

4. Set up environment variables:

   - Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.
   - Add the following environment variables:
     ```
     PORT=8080
     DATABASE=<mongodb-connection-url>
     SECRET=<secret-key-for-jwt>
     ```

   ```

6. Open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## Folder Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `backend`: Contains the server-side code and API routes.
- `frontend`: Contains the client-side React.js code.
- `public`: Contains static assets used by the frontend.
- `models`: Defines the Mongoose models for MongoDB.
- `controllers`: Handles the business logic of the application.
- `routes`: Defines the API routes and their corresponding controller methods.
- `config`: Contains configuration files and utility functions.
- `middlewares`: Custom middleware functions.
- `views`: Contains server-side rendered views (if applicable).

## Configuration

The application can be configured using the following environment variables in the `.env` file:

- `PORT`: The port number on which the server should run (default: 5000).
- `DATABASE`: The MongoDB connection URL.
- `SECRET`: The secret key used for JSON Web Token (JWT) encryption.

## Deployment

To deploy the application to a production environment, you can follow these general steps:

1. Build the frontend:

   ```shell
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. Start the server:

   ```shell
   cd ..
   npm start
   ```

3. Set up a production-ready MongoDB database and update the `DATABASE` environment variable accordingly.

4. Configure a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) to handle incoming requests and forward them to the Node.js server.
